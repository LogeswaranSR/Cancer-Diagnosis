# Cancer-Diagnosis
An analysis of the Cancer dataset

# Overview
We have a dataset of cancer tumor details. The tumor is classified as either Benign (B) or Malignant (M) , denoted in the 'diagnosis' column. 

The data is scaled using StandardScaler, and Dimensionality Reduction (Principal Component Analysis) is applied, with the output data ranging from 2 columns to 30 columns.

A Logistic Regression Model is trained based on the transformed datasets and their accuracy is compared.

# Conclusion
The dataset can be reduced to atmost 8 columns, in order to preserve accuracy of the models used.

# Libraries used
  Pandas
  
  Numpy
  
  Matplotlib
  
  Seaborn
